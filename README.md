# Game:TIC-TAC-TOE.

* Tic-tac-toe is a two player game. The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
* I Assigned O for player 1 and X for player two. if one of player who first gets 3 marks in vertically,horizantally or diagonally wins the game.
* To Restart the process I assigned "R" Key.When we press "R" The screen will be clean and then we can continue the game.
* Pygame is a great library that will allow us to create the window and draw images and shapes on the window. This way we will capture mouse coordinates and identify the block where we need to mark ‘X’ or ‘O’. Then we will check if the user wins the game or not.
